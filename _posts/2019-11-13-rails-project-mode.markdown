For my rails project, I decided to use the same model I used in my Sinatra Project. I saw that the rails project requirements was literally everything I did in my Sinatra project. I didn't get to completely implement all the features I wanted in Sinatra, but I got it done in rails!

To Recap.

I created an Event Planner app where a User can sign up/log in. The user then can create Events. User can add Guests to their guestlist per event.

Guests can RSVP by going to the event's website and click on the RSVP link. This page will ask the guest to type in their first and last name. If the guest is invited to that event, guest will be able to respond via the form presented.
