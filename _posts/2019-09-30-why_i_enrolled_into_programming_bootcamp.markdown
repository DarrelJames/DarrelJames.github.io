It was about a year and a half ago. I was in a Discord server when a friend I played counterstrike with few years back came in. We make small talk. Long story short. He does software testing. Since I do manual testing he tells me to look into it and learn python to start.

I start Google searching how to become an automation engineer and couldn't really find any structured way on how to get started. I told another friend of mine, Vandgen, that was looking into getting automation or software testing, and coincidently he was learning python himself.

I asked him where he was learning and he pointed me to this app called Sololearn. So, I go and download this app and start learning python. I was able to finish the lessons in a few days. They send you a certificate of completion for the language you're learning.

> Now what?

> Time to create an app right?

**Wrong.**

I learned the basics but had no idea to even begin to creating an app. So I just left it at that.

> programming was always something I was interested in


Fast forward to now. I started looking up about programming again and came up with ads about programming bootcamps. I thought, this is what I needed a year ago.

It's week 4 already in the bootcamp and I'm loving it. It's structured and you build on the skills you learn from previous lessons and labs.

I've created my first CLI scraper ruby gem and though it can use improvements. I'm proud of what I created.
