For my Javascript project, I decided to create a pomodoro timer app and to meet the requirements the app logs all your coding sessions into the database. You can add notes to the sessions to keep track of what you did during that session.

Initially, I wanted to be able to link a github project repo to the session and fetch all the commits you've made during that particular coding session, but decided to just go for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). There's many features i'd like to add like being able to set the work and break timer.

My project wasn't super hard to finish but I did run into a few problems. Working with ruby for the last 2.5 months, I got used to ruby implicitly returning the last evaluated expression, whereas in javascript, you have to tell it explicitly to return values. It was kinda frustrating.

I kinda procrastinated on my project because, well, I love helping my fellow students out. Whether its troubleshooting some of their code, trying to build up a feature for their project, or going over a lab with them to help them understand more.
