I just passed my final project review! 

After moving ahead to 2 different cohorts i've tackled Flatiron's course. The experience was great and met a tons of friends along the way. 

As for what's next on the agenda.

While I start my jobsearch, I'll definately will still be coding a lot. I got some projects in mind like creating a personal website and blog.
I also want to go back and refactor my old code or port them over to have a Javascript front end with a rails api.

I have a technical interview wednesday, so i'll I have to prepare for that.

Keep on grinding
