I"]<p>It was about a year and a half ago. I was in a Discord server when a friend I played counterstrike with few years back came in. We make small talk. Long story short. He does software testing. Since I do manual testing he tells me to look into it and learn python to start.</p>

<p>I start Google searching how to become an automation engineer and couldn’t really find any structured way on how to get started. I told another friend of mine, Vandgen, that was looking into getting automation or software testing, and coincidently he was learning python himself.</p>

<p>I asked him where he was learning and he pointed me to this app called Sololearn. So, I go and download this app and start learning python. I was able to finish the lessons in a few days. They send you a certificate of completion for the language you’re learning.</p>

  <p>Now what?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time to create an app right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p>

<p>I learned the basics but had no idea to even begin to creating an app. So I just left it at that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>programming was always something I was interested in</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fast forward to now. I started looking up about programming again and came up with ads about programming bootcamps. I thought, this is what I needed a year ago.</p>

<p>It’s week 4 already in the bootcamp and I’m loving it. It’s structured and you build on the skills you learn from previous lessons and labs.</p>

<p>I’ve created my first CLI scraper ruby gem and though it can use improvements. I’m proud of what I created.</p>
