I"r<p>Whenever my girlfriend travels, she likes to visit the local museums. So I decided to create a gem that would scrape a website with a list of museums. I did a quick google search and found this website, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/museumday/museum-day-2019/">Smithsonian</a>. They hold an annual event called Museum Day, which happened two weeks ago.</p>
